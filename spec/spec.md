#The EPL BP Manager

The EPL BP manager is a tool for use inside the Edmonton Public Library. The goal for the tool is that it will allow
EPL employees to be able to keep track of and update their work in an easier method than emailing many
non-standardized spreadsheets between employees. Business plans can be created, modified, and viewed by various users
at different permission levels. Users can have work assigned to them, as well as assigning work to other users as
appropriate.

Every user is able to view the entire business plan information, including progress and success measures. Authorized
users can add notes to their work, and update their progress. Users may search on the page, and filter by certain
elements as required. Administrators will be able to create, modify, and delete users.
